# Free Code Camp - JavaScript Challenges

Free Code Camp is a free online program that teaches full-stack web development. I began work at FCC before starting Dev Bootcamp's web development immersive in the fall of 2015. While I was busy at DBC, FCC greatly expanded their curriculum, and added certifications in a variety of areas. Now that I have finished the DBC program, I am working on the new challenges at FCC to expand my experience with JavaScript. I am archiving my code for the more elaborate challenges here at Github, as well.

## Basic Algorithm Scripting
Here are my solutions to the new challenges in this section:

#### Caesar's Cipher
FCC Instructions: "Write a function which takes a [ROT13](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROT13) encoded string as input and returns a decoded string. All letters will be uppercase. Do not transform any non-alphabetic character (i.e. spaces, punctuation), but do pass them on."

## Advanced Algorithm Scripting
Here are my solutions to the new challenges in this section:

#### Validate US Telephone Numbers: phone_num.js
FCC instructions: "For this challenge you will be presented with a string such as 800-692-7753 or 8oo-six427676;laskdjf. Your job is to validate or reject the US phone number based on any combination of the formats provided above. The area code is required. If the country code is provided, you must confirm that the country code is 1. Return true if the string is a valid US phone number; otherwise false."

#### Symmetric Difference: sym_diff.js
FCC instructions: "Create a function that takes two or more arrays and returns an array of the symmetric difference (△ or ⊕) of the provided arrays."

#### Exact Change: exact_change.js
FCC instructions: "Design a cash register drawer function that accepts purchase price as the first argument, payment as the second argument, and cash-in-drawer (cid) as the third argument. cid is a 2d array listing available currency. Return the string 'Insufficient Funds' if cash-in-drawer is less than the change due. Return the string 'Closed' if cash-in-drawer is equal to the change due. Otherwise, return change in coin and bills, sorted in highest to lowest order."
